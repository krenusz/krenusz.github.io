							<h2>Data Science</h2>
                            Over two years of Machine Learning experience I have gained heuristic knowledge regarding the End to End Machine Learning process flow. The technical implementation was achieved mainly by Structural Python Programming, however the knowledge of the R language was required to support the work of my Team Mermbers.
                            At the earlier period my responsibility was to build up mostly Decision Tree based models (DT, RandomForest) for classification and regression. And to build Clustering models using different distance matrixes (Euclidean,Gower,etc...).  
                            After I have dived deeply into Deep Learning, I have built up several Neural Network model. In the latest period I have mostly focused on my Deep Convolutional Neural Network model based on Inception Network for Image recognition and Video analytics.

							<h2>Process Automation</h2>
                            It was my responsibility to find the State of the art Automation solution for the End to End Machine Learning process, hence I gained insight into the current best solution for every individual usecase. We have tried several options (Microsoft ML Studio via Logic App, Azure Automation Developement App, Azure DataBricks, Windows Task Scheduler, etc..). 
                            In a lot of case the more simple ideas fit the best (e.g. To embed the Machine Learning process directly after Data Engineering process inside of SQL Agent).

							<h2>Data Engineering and Business Intelligence</h2>
                            Working closely with the Data Engineer and Data Analyst colleagues in a small team I have gained visibility on the processes beyond Machine Learning (e.g. ETL and SSIS; Power BI and Tableau). From the Cloud to the On-Premises solutions, We have walked through the possibilities to find the best fit for our usecases from the Data Engineering point of view. 
                            Regarding the Business Intelligence, it was part of my job to gain experience in different BI apps, where I got familiar with the logic of querys and custom visualizations. Due to my Python and R knowledge, the embedded script features in these platforms made this process easier.

							<h2>Udemy, Kaggle - Data Science Preparation</h2>
							<h4>Feb 2018 - Jun 2018 </h4>
							<p> I have completed the Python programming for Data Science course on Udemy, which was in perfect connection with my previous Python knowledge. I did dive deep into the specified libraries of Python (Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit Learn) which was required to became a Data Scientist. In addition I have looked into the R programming language, and started to gain knowledge.
                            <br>When I have received my certificate I have turned my direction to the Kaggle competition platform, where I have faced myself with Online Competition challenges.
                            House Prices titled world competition for Data Scientists:
                            It was a Regression problem.
                            My job was to predict the sales price for each house in the test dataset. For each Id in the test set, I must had to predict the value of the SalePrice variable.
                            Right after I have started to seek for Data Scientist positions to find my required Business challenges.</p>
